> I am actively looking for motivated graduate and undergraduate students working on medical text mining, machine translation, causality analysis, electroencephalogram and NLP, etc. 
If you are interested, please e-mail me with your CV.  

## Graduate students

I will consider accepting 2~3 students to start in fall 2021. If you are interested in working on NLP and feeling "stupid" or "challengeless" about it, believe me, you may be the right candidate. 

Depending on their experience, interests, and career goals, some of my students choose to collaborate with me directly on one of the projects I am heavily involved in. Some others work on projects not directly related to my core interests. Yet others initially work on one of the projects led directly by me and later transition into more independent projects. In all cases, I encourage my students to find, design, and execute their research on their own, with me as a collaborator. I believe this approach helps them to become independent and creative scientists/engineers.


## Undergraduate students

Students are welcome to participate in the research conducted in our lab throughout the year. We often have funded opportunities in summer.
